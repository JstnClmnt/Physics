**Physics+Computer-Science+Mathematics**

This is my repository for everything including physics,computer science, and mathematics

I will start creating codes for this repository once I finish my thesis. 

Suggestions are welcome for ideas including physics+computer science!

I'm also open for collaboration, people/students who are taking physics but needed some programming help are welcome!
